# MIT PhD Prep Journey 

Hi, I'm Akshay Benhynn  ðŸ‘‹  
This repository documents my daily progress towards my ultimate goal:  
 **PhD in AI at MIT CSAIL (2028) â†’ Research Scientist at top AI labs (OpenAI, DeepMind, FAIR, etc.)**

---

## Daily Missions
I follow a 3-hour daily routine (Math + Python + AI Project) as a game-style journey.  
Each day = 150 XP (50 Math, 50 Python, 50 AI Project).  

| Day | Mission | XP | Notes |
|-----|---------|----|-------|
| 1   | Vectors & Attention Project | 150 | Started the journey ðŸš€ |

## Repo Structure
- `daily_logs/` â†’ Day-wise notes + Vs code
- `projects/` â†’ Larger AI projects built during the journey  

---

## Final Goal
- Get PhD admission at MIT CSAIL (2028)  
- Publish research at NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML  
- Become a Research Scientist at top AI labs  

Stay tuned â€” Iâ€™ll push updates daily!
